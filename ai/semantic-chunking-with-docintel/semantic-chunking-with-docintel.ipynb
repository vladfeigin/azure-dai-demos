       " Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Abstract'}, page_content=\"arXiv:2212.10496v1 [cs.IR] 20 Dec 2022  \\nWhile dense retrieval has been shown effec- tive and efficient across tasks and languages, it remains difficult to create effective fully zero-shot dense retrieval systems when no rel- evance label is available. In this paper, we recognize the difficulty of zero-shot learning and encoding relevance. Instead, we pro- pose to pivot through Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE). Given a query, HyDE first zero-shot instructs an instruction-following language model (e.g. InstructGPT) to gen- erate a hypothetical document. The docu- ment captures relevance patterns but is unreal and may contain false details. Then, an un- supervised contrastively learned encoder (e.g. Contriever) encodes the document into an embedding vector. This vector identifies a neighborhood in the corpus embedding space, where similar real documents are retrieved based on vector similarity. This second step ground the generated document to the actual corpus, with the encoder's dense bottleneck filtering out the incorrect details. Our exper- iments show that HyDE significantly outper- forms the state-of-the-art unsupervised dense retriever Contriever and shows strong per- formance comparable to fine-tuned retrievers, across various tasks (e.g. web search, QA, fact verification) and languages (e.g. sw, ko, ja).1\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Header 1': '1 Introduction'}, page_content='Dense retrieval (Lee et al., 2019; Karpukhin et al., 2020), the method of retrieving documents using semantic embedding similarities, has been shown successful across tasks like web search, question answering, and fact verification. A variety of meth- ods such as negative mining (Xiong et al., 2021; Qu et al., 2021), distillation (Qu et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2021b; Hofstätter et al., 2021) and task-specific  \\npre-training (Izacard et al., 2021; Gao and Callan, 2021; Lu et al., 2021; Gao and Callan, 2022; Liu and Shao, 2022) have been proposed to improve the effectiveness of supervised dense retrieval models.  \\nOn the other hand, zero-shot dense retrieval still remains difficult. Many recent works consider the alternative transfer learning setup, where the dense retrievers are trained on a high-resource dataset and then evaluated on queries from new tasks. The MS- MARCO collection (Bajaj et al., 2016), a massive judged dataset with a large number of judged query- document pairs, is arguably the most commonly used. As argued by Izacard et al. (2021), in prac- tice, however, the existence of such a large dataset cannot always be assumed. Even MS-MARCO re- stricts commercial use and cannot be adopted in a variety of real-world search scenarios.  \\nIn this paper, we aim to build effective fully zero-shot dense retrieval systems that require no relevance supervision, work out-of-box and gener- alize across tasks. As supervision is not available, we start by examining self-supervised representa- tion learning methods. Modern deep learning en- ables two distinct learning algorithms. At the token level, generative large language models (LLM) pre- trained on large corpus have demonstrated strong natural language understanding (NLU) and gen- eration (NLG) capabilities (Brown et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021; Rae et al., 2021; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022). At the document level, text (chunk) encoders pre-trained with contrastive objectives learn to encode document-document similarity into inner-product (Izacard et al., 2021; Gao and Callan, 2022). On top of these, one extra insight into LLM is borrowed: the LLMs further trained to follow instructions can zero-shot generalize to diverse un- seen instructions (Ouyang et al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2022; Min et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022). Ouyang et al. (2022) show that with a small amount of data, GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) models can be aligned  \\n<!-- Footnote=\"Equal contribution.\" -->  \\n<!-- Footnote=\"\"No models were trained or fine-tuned in making this pre- print.

First, we feed the query to the generative model and instruct it to \"write a document that answers the question\", i.e. a hypothetical document. We expect the generative process to capture \"relevance\" by giving an example; the generated document is not real, can contain factual errors but is like a relevant document. In the second step, we use an unsupervised contrastive encoder to encode this document into an embedding vector. Here, we expect the encoder\\'s dense bottleneck to serve a lossy compressor, where the extra (hallucinated) details are filtered out from the embedding. We use this vector to search against the corpus embeddings. The most similar real documents are retrieved and returned. The retrieval leverages document-document similarity encoded in the inner-product during contrastive training. Note that, interestingly, with HyDE factorization, the query-document similarity score is no longer explicitly modeled nor computed. Instead, the retrieval task is cast into two NLU and NLG tasks.  \\nHyDE appears unsupervised. No model is trained in HyDE: both the generative model and the con- trastive encoder remain intact. Supervision signals were only involved in instruction learning of our backbone LLM.  \\nIn our experiments, we show HyDE using Instruct- GPT (Ouyang et al., 2022) and Contriever (Izacard et al., 2021) as backbone models significantly out- performs the previous state-of-the-art Contriever- only zero-shot no-relevance system on 11 queries  \\nsets, covering tasks like Web Search, Question Answering, Fact Verification and languages like Swahili, Korean, Japanese.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Header 1': '2 Related Works'}, page_content='Dense Retrieval (Lee et al., 2019; Karpukhin et al., 2020) has been extensively studied after the emergence of pre-trained Transformer language models (Devlin et al., 2019). Researchers stud- ied the metric learning problems, such as training loss (Karpukhin et al., 2020) and negative sam- pling (Xiong et al., 2021; Qu et al., 2021), and also introduced distillation (Qu et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2021b; Hofstätter et al., 2021). Later works studied the second stage pre-training of language model specifically for retrieval (Izacard et al., 2021; Gao and Callan, 2021; Lu et al., 2021; Gao and Callan, 2022; Liu and Shao, 2022).  \\nThe popularity of dense retrieval can be partially attributed to the rich and successful research in very efficient minimum inner product search (MIPS) at very large (billion) scales (Johnson et al., 2017).  \\nInstructions-Following Language Models Soon after the emergence of LLMs, several groups of researchers discover that LLMs trained on data consisting of instructions and their execution can zero-shot generalize to perform new tasks with new instructions (Ouyang et al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2022; Min et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022). This can be done by standard supervised sequence-to-sequence learning or more effectively with reinforcement learning (Ouyang et al., 2022).  \\nConcurrent to us, Asai et al. (2022) studied \"Task-aware Retrieval with Instructions\". They fine-tuned dense encoders that can also encode task-specific instruction prepended to query. In comparison, we use an unsupervised encoder and handle different tasks and their instruction with an\\n:selected:\\ninstruction following generative LLM, as described above.  \\nZero-Shot Dense Retrieval The tasks of zero- shot (dense) retrieval are arguably empirically de- fined by Thakur et al. (2021) for the neural re- trieval community. Their BEIR benchmark con- sists of diverse retrieval tasks. The paper and many follow-up research generally consider the Transfer Learning setup where the dense re- triever is first learned using a diverse and richly supervised corpus and query collection, namely MS-MARCO (Thakur et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022).  \\nHowever, as stated by Izacard et al. (2021), such a large collection can rarely be assumed. In this paper, therefore, we study the problem of building effective dense retrieval systems without relevance labels. Similar to Izacard et al. (2021), we also do not assume access to the test time corpora for training. This is a more realistic setup and prevents over-engineering on the test corpora.  \\nBy the definition in Sachan et al. (2022), our setup can be roughly considered as \"unsuper- vised\". Strictly, as with Sachan et al. (2022), the only supervision resides in the LLM, in the pro- cessing of learning to follow instructions.  \\nGenerative Retrieval Generative search is a new class of retrieval methods that use neural generative models as search indices (Metzler et al., 2021; Tay et al., 2022; Bevilacqua et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2022). These models use (constrained) decoding to generate document identifiers, such as id and sub-string, which map directly to real documents. They have to go through special training procedures over relevance data; effective search may also need to use novel forms of search indices (Bevilacqua et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2022). In comparison, our method uses the standard MIPS index and requires no training or training data. Our generative model produces an intermediate hypothetical document to be fed into a dense encoder, instead of a real document.'),\n",

This is done by generating documents, i.e. providing exam- ples. Critically, here we offload relevance mod- eling from representation learning model to an NLG model that generalizes significantly more eas- ily, naturally, and effectively (Brown et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022).

Dense retrievers consider vector similarities while self-attentive re-rankers regression scores. In comparison, the concept of relevance in HyDE is captured by an NLG model and the language gener- ation process. We demonstrate in many cases, HyDE can be as effective as dense retrievers that learn to model numerical relevance scores. So, is numeri- cal relevance just a statistical artifact of language understanding? Will a weak retriever theoretically suffice as the NLU & NLG models rapidly become stronger? Rushing to conclusions is not smart; more works need to be done to get answers. With this paper, we just want to raise these questions.  \\nConcretely in this paper, we introduce a new paradigm of interactions between LLM and dense encoder/retriever. We demonstrate (part of) rel- evance modeling and instruction understanding can be delegated to the more powerful and flex- ible LLM. As a consequence, the need for rele- vance labels is removed. We are excited to see how this can be generalized further to more so- phisticated tasks like multi-hop retrieval/QA and conversational search.  \\nWe argue HyDE is also of practical use though not necessarily over the entire lifespan of a search sys- tem. At the very beginning of the life of the search system, serving queries using HyDE offers perfor- mance comparable to a fine-tuned model, which no other relevance-free model can offer. As the search log grows, a supervised dense retriever can be gradually rolled out. As the dense retriever grows stronger, more queries will be routed to it, with only less common and emerging ones going to HyDE backend.'),\n",
