# Fabric AI Observability & Evaluation

## Overview

The **Fabric** is a Microsoft SaaS platform it's a solution to enhance data observability and troubleshooting . It provides:

- **Tracing**: Trace your application's runtime and data pipelines using advanced telemetry-based instrumentation integrated with Microsoft Fabric's tools.
- **Evaluation**: Leverage built-in analytics and AI capabilities to benchmark application performance using custom evaluations and metrics, enabling deeper insights into system performance.
- **Datasets**: Create and manage versioned datasets within the Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse for experimentation, evaluation, and machine learning model fine-tuning, supporting end-to-end workflows.

Fabric seamlessly integrates with Microsoftâ€™s ecosystem, offering a comprehensive suite of tools such as Real-Time Analytics, Data Activator for alerting, and KQL Queryset for advanced querying. 
It provides robust features for organizations looking to build, deploy, and monitor secure and scalable solutions, all within a unified platform.
